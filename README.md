# Parallelising in OpenMP

OpenMP, or Open Multi-Processing, is an API (Application Programming Interface) that supports shared-memory multiprocessing programming in C, C++, and Fortran. It's widely used for parallel programming on shared-memory systems, where multiple processors or cores can access the same memory.

Architecture:

Threads: OpenMP operates on the concept of threads. Threads are independent sequences of instructions that can be executed concurrently. OpenMP allows developers to create and manage multiple threads within a program.
Shared Memory: All threads in an OpenMP program share the same memory space. This shared memory model simplifies data sharing among threads, as they can access and modify shared variables directly.
Master-Worker Model: OpenMP follows a master-worker model, where one thread (the master thread) creates a team of threads (worker threads) to perform parallel tasks. The master thread also participates in the computation.
Role in Parallel Programming:

Parallelism: OpenMP enables programmers to add parallelism to their code easily. By annotating sections of code with OpenMP directives, developers can instruct the compiler to parallelize those sections, distributing work across multiple threads for concurrent execution.
Scalability: OpenMP supports scalability by allowing programs to utilize all available processor cores. As hardware with more cores becomes common, OpenMP facilitates efficient utilization of these resources, improving performance for parallelizable tasks.
Synchronization: OpenMP provides constructs for thread synchronization, such as barriers, atomic operations, and critical sections. These constructs help manage shared resources and ensure data consistency when multiple threads access shared variables simultaneously.
Portability: One of OpenMP's strengths is its portability across different platforms and compilers. Programs written with OpenMP directives can typically run on various systems without significant modifications, provided the compilers support OpenMP standards.
Productivity: OpenMP promotes productivity by offering a high-level approach to parallel programming. Developers can focus on expressing parallelism using directives rather than dealing with low-level thread creation, synchronization, and management, which can be error-prone and complex.
Overall, OpenMP simplifies parallel programming by abstracting many of the complexities associated with multi-threading and shared-memory architectures, making it an essential tool for exploiting parallelism in modern computing systems.

Single Source Shortest Path (SSSP) Algorithm:

Algorithm Overview: SSSP finds the shortest paths from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph. The algorithm typically uses techniques like Dijkstra's algorithm or Bellman-Ford algorithm.
Parallelization Approach:
Data Decomposition: One common approach to parallelize SSSP is to partition the graph into smaller subgraphs or chunks. Each thread or process works on its assigned subgraph, updating shortest paths independently.
Task Parallelism: Another approach is task parallelism, where different threads or processes handle different vertices simultaneously. This approach is suitable for graphs with irregular structures or varying edge densities.
Optimizations: Parallel SSSP algorithms often employ optimizations like work queues, priority queues, or delta-stepping to reduce synchronization overhead and improve parallel efficiency.
Strongly Connected Components (SCC) Algorithm:

Algorithm Overview: SCC identifies groups of vertices in a directed graph where every vertex in a group is reachable from every other vertex in the same group.
Parallelization Approach:
Tarjan's Algorithm: Tarjan's algorithm for SCC can be parallelized efficiently. It uses depth-first search (DFS) and a stack to identify SCCs. Each thread can perform DFS starting from different vertices, merging SCCs as necessary.
Kosaraju's Algorithm: Another popular SCC algorithm, Kosaraju's algorithm, involves two DFS passes. Parallelizing this algorithm involves distributing DFS operations across threads and merging SCCs afterward.
Work Sharing: SCC algorithms often involve a lot of shared work, such as marking visited vertices or updating component IDs. Work-sharing constructs like OpenMP's parallel for or tasks can be used to distribute this work among threads effectively.
Forward Backward (FB) Algorithm:

Algorithm Overview: The Forward Backward algorithm is used in various contexts, such as dynamic programming, signal processing, and machine learning. It often involves iterative computations that can benefit from parallelization.
Parallelization Approach:
Data Parallelism: FB algorithms that operate on large datasets or matrices can be parallelized using data parallelism. Each thread can handle a portion of the data, performing forward and backward computations independently.
Vectorization: Utilizing SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) instructions or hardware accelerators like GPUs can significantly speed up FB algorithms by processing multiple data elements simultaneously.
Parallel Reduction: FB algorithms may involve reduction operations, such as summing or aggregating results. Parallel reduction techniques can be employed to efficiently compute these reductions across multiple threads or processes.
In summary, parallelizing algorithms like SSSP, SCC, and FB requires careful consideration of data structures, algorithmic properties, and parallelization techniques. Leveraging task parallelism, data decomposition, work sharing, vectorization, and parallel reduction can lead to efficient parallel implementations of these algorithms, harnessing the power of modern parallel computing architectures.
