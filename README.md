# Parallelising in OpenMP

OpenMP, or Open Multi-Processing, is an API (Application Programming Interface) that supports shared-memory multiprocessing programming in C, C++, and Fortran. It's widely used for parallel programming on shared-memory systems, where multiple processors or cores can access the same memory.
